# 3D active-hydrodynamics
Repository for OpenFPM code that solves the 3D active Ericksen-Leslie Model  

The codes in this repository requires the installation of OpenFPM.
The file anaEulerian.cpp is the C++ code that can be used to simulate the active Ericksen-Leslie hydrodynamics in an Eulerian frame of reference.

The file anaHyb.cpp is the C++ code that can be used to simulate the active Ericksen-Leslie hydrodynamics in a Lagrangian frame of reference with remeshing at every time step.

The file annulus.cpp is the C++ code that can be used to simulate the active Ericksen-Leslie hydrodynamics in an Eulerian frame of reference for an annular geometry.
